# Overview #

## Requirements ##

* From version 1.0.1+: XLR 4.8.0+

## Installation ##

* Define an Access Token using the VersionOne UI: Go to `Configuration - Applications` and add a new Application with name `XLRelease`. Use `Access Token` as an authentication mechanism.
* Place the versionone plugin into plugins
* Place the versionone java sdk into plugins (download from [Fixes V1Connector](https://github.com/jdewinne/VersionOne.SDK.Java.APIClient)). A [pull request](https://github.com/versionone/VersionOne.SDK.Java.APIClient/pull/21) has been send, as the official sdk can't handle properly failing requests.
